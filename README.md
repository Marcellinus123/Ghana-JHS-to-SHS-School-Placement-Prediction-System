# Ghana JHS School Placement Prediction System  
### Built with PHP, MySQLi & Basic PHP-ML

A predictive academic placement system developed for **Junior High Schools (JHS) in Ghana**, designed to analyze student academic performance and estimate their most likely **Senior High School (SHS)** placement and programme allocation.  

The goal of this system is to assist schools, guidance counsellors, parents, and students with an **early insight into SHS placement outcomes**, using student performance data from **JHS1 to JHS3** plus **at least one mock examination**.

This solution is particularly aligned with the Ghana Education Service (GES) concept of the CSSPS style of selection, but in a **local, simplified, in-house prediction model**, built using **PHP-ML** and standard **PHP & MySQLi backend**.

## System Overview

Ghanaian JHS students have multiple academic records across three years, culminating in the BECE exam and national placement system.  
However, before official placement results are released, schools and parents often lack accurate, data-driven expectations.

This system fills that gap by:

- Collecting historical academic records of JHS students  
- Analyzing their academic performance curve  
- Applying basic ML classification and prediction  
- Providing insight into likely **SHS school category assignment** (A / B / C / D)  
- Suggesting likely **SHS programme** the student may qualify for  
- Helping stakeholders identify best-fit options and expectations early

It does **not replace official GES placement** but aids **prediction, counseling, planning, and student mentoring**.

## Machine Learning Logic (PHP-ML)

While lightweight, the ML logic applies:

- Basic classification models  
- Linear scoring & normalization of academic history  
- Weighted average processing  
- Pattern trend analysis (improvement vs decline)  
- Predictive approximation based on performance categories  

The engine uses **PHP-ML** library techniques and custom rules reflecting typical CSSPS-style evaluation logic.

### ML Input Data Considered

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
JHS1 Scores | Term 1‚Äì3 subject performance  
JHS2 Scores | Term 1‚Äì3 subject performance  
JHS3 Scores | Term 1‚Äì2 academic scores  
Mock Exam | Major weight factor  
Trend Factor | Consistency & improvement  
Subject Strength | Sciences, Business, Arts, etc.  

### Output Prediction

- **Likely SHS category** (A/B/C/D)
- **Likely programme** recommendation
- **Confidence level** indicator
- **Guidance remarks**

## Workflow

1. JHS Admin creates school account  
2. Admin enters/uploads student records (JHS1‚ÄìJHS3 + Mock)  
3. System processes academic data  
4. ML model classifies based on patterns + historical weights  
5. Results displayed:  
   - Category prediction  
   - Programme recommendation  
   - Remarks + confidence score  
6. Admin downloads reports  
7. Expected placement guidance issued to students/parents
